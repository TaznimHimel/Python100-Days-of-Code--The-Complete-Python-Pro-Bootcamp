#This is the solution for the 3rd level of the maze in Reeborg's World.
#The solution is to use a for loop to repeat the jump function 6 times.
#The jump function is defined to move, turn left, move, turn right, move, turn right, move, and turn left.
#The turn_right function is defined to turn left three times.
#The jump function is then called 6 times using a for loop.
#The result is that Reeborg moves in a zigzag pattern across the maze to the end.
#The code is then executed in Reeborg's World to solve the maze.
